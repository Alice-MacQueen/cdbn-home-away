Introduction
Bean Ecology
Bean Domestication
Bean Improvement
Local Adaptation

Questions
What is the role of plant breeding on local adaptation of a selfing species?


What is the role of plant breeding on local adaptation  of different domestication events?
What is the role of local adaptation over time?

Potential Data
