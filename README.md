Introduction
Bean Ecology
Bean Domestication
Bean Improvement
Local Adaptation

Questions
What is the role of plant breeding on local adaptation of a selfing species?


What is the role of plant breeding on local adaptation  of different domestication events?
What is the role of local adaptation over time?

Potential Data

Biomass over 35 years, 11 common checks, multiple locations
Yield over 35 years, 11 common checks, multiple locations
non-conformable arrays
Kinship Matrix for all ~300 accession

Potential Analysis

Standard expectation of home field advantage
Kinship standardized expected Home field advantage
Different areal extents of local
Universal and local phenotypes → performance, and traits controlling
